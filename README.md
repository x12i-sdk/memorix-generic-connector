# @x12i/memorix-generic-connector usage example

Published generic Memorix connector runtime (source + target tools).

This consuming application demonstrates **use the source namespace without colliding with target exports** using the published npm package, pinned to `1.8.1`.

## Run

Requires Node.js 24 or newer and npm. The example needs no service credentials.

```sh
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm start
```

## Example

[`src/index.mjs`](src/index.mjs) contains the complete example. Assertions check the demonstrated behavior and the program prints a small result.

## When to use the package

- Run a metadata-defined source connector.
- Execute a metadata-defined target operation through the generic runtime.

## Validation scope

It does not execute a skill/model, run a production pipeline, connect to MongoDB, materialize live relationships, acquire provider data or perform an outbound delivery. The in-memory examples do not establish durability across process restarts.
